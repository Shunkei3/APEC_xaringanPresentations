+ It's funny that I, a Japanese person, me, is talking about this xaringan package. 
+ Because the name "xaringan" comes from the famous Japanese anime "Naruto.", which is a anime about ninjas with special power. 

+ Simply put, Sharingan is a two part eye abilities.

+ The eye of insight allows the users to see things that otherwise they would not be able to see, and to also copy and memorize almost anything they see. 

+ The eye of Hypnotism can put their opponent into a trance.

+ I think Xie, who invented xaringan puts it best. 

+ "A Presentation...."

## What does xaringan do?

.blockquote[
The xaringan package is an R Markdown extension based on the JavaScript library remark.js to generate HTML5 presentations. 
]

<br>

Multiple components are involved to create cool HTML5 slides. 

--

1.&nbsp; remark.js (JavaScript `r fa("js", height='25px', fill = "black")` + Markdown `r fa("markdown", height='25px', fill = "black")`)

--

2.&nbsp;<b>xaringan</b> connects remark.js to R markdown. 

--

`r fa('lightbulb',height='20px',fill='steelblue')` See [this blog](https://yihui.org/en/2017/08/why-xaringan-remark-js/) for more about *xaringan/ remark.js*. 

???
+ remark.js is a tools to create slides that can be used in browser. 

+ https://www.verouden.net/slides/presentation-xaringan/#10
  + Basically xaringan injected the chakra of R Markdown (minus Pandoc) into remark.js. The slides are rendered by remark.js in the web browser, and the Markdown source needed by remark.js is generated from R Markdown (knitr).


+ I'm a little unsure about how the basic mechanism works but xaringan takes remark.js (which is a combination of javascript and markdown) and connects it with basic HTML slides that we can then use to present data and other information created through R in an interactive way.



---
class: middle

## Why xaringan might be your new presentation tool?

I like xaringan presentations mainly because...

`r fa('lightbulb',height='20px',fill='steelblue')` You can write everything in R Markdown.

--

`r fa('lightbulb',height='20px',fill='steelblue')` You can easily incorporate figures and tables created with `r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")`: 
 
  + `r fa('comments',height='20px',fill='steelblue')` You can work on figures and tables within the xaringan .Rmd file.

  + `r fa('comments',height='20px',fill='steelblue')` or, if you have .Rmd file that contain all figures and tables you used in writing your paper, you can directly call those objects by loading the file in the xaringan .Rmd file. 

````markdown
`r ''````{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::knit_child("PrepareResults.rmd", quiet = TRUE)
```
````

???

+ Xaringan is helpful because we can do all of our work within R from doing data analysis to creating presentations. As opposed to using another tool like Powerpoint or Latex for presentations.

+ I personally prefer to do all of my work with the same tool because it helps my workflow. With the help of xaringan I can take any figures or tables I created in R and easily incorporate them into my presentations.

+ At the bottom of the slide, you can see my workflow. I usually put all of my figures and tables into a single R Markdown file so I can pull from this single source for all of my papers and presentations

---
class: middle

### Furthermore...

In terms of its functionality, 

`r fontawesome::fa('lightbulb',height='20px',fill='steelblue')` There are many awesome functionalities in xaringan! For example, `code highlighter` and `clipboard`. For lab session involving coding, these functions are helpful for both instructors and students. 

--

<br>

`r fontawesome::fa('lightbulb',height='20px',fill='steelblue')` xaringan slides allow interactive presentations, which potentially make your presentation more intriguing and fun!


???
+ Well there are lots of options to make presentation slides. I think the most common ways is to

# Math

LaTeX commands works fine (most of the time). 

For example, 

<br>

.content-box-yellow[Example 1: Inline equations]
````markdown
$\omega_1=(6,10)$ and $\omega_2=(6,0)$
````

$\omega_1=(6,10)$ and $\omega_2=(6,0)$

<br>

.content-box-yellow[Example 2: Equations]
````markdown
$$U_j(x_j, y) = x_j + \theta_j ln \, y$$
````

$$U_j(x_j, y) = x_j + \theta_j ln \, y$$

---
class: middle

# Math 

.content-box-yellow[Example 3: Equations]
````markdown
\begin{aligned}
\max_{x_1,y_1} \quad & U_1(x_1, y_1)=x_1y_1 \\
\textrm{s.t.} \quad & max[x_2, y_2] = \overline{u_2} \\
  & x_1 + x_2 = 16 \\
  & y_1 + y_2 = 16
\end{aligned}
````

\begin{aligned}
\max_{x_1,y_1} \quad & U_1(x_1, y_1)=x_1y_1 \\

  & x_1 + x_2 = 16 \\
  & y_1 + y_2 = 16
\end{aligned}


???
+ You can even write complicated equations. 
+ Though I know there are some limitations for math expressions in Xiaringan, so far I have never run into any trouble.

## Figures

.content-box-yellow[Examples: Jensen's inequality]

.panelset[ 

.panel[.panel-name[Example 1 : g(x) is convex]
.left5[

Suppose that $g(x)=x^2$.

.small-code[
```{r, echo=T}
set.seed(356)

# Create a sequence of X from a uniformal distribution

$$\color{darkgreen}{g(E[X])} \leq \color{blue}{E[g(X)]}$$
  ]
]

.panel[.panel-name[Example 2: g(x) is concave]
.left5[

Suppose that $g(x)=\sqrt{x}$.

.small-code[
```{r, echo=T, out.width = "50%"}
# /*===== Convex case: g(X)=X^(1/2) =====*/

## Line highlighting

An example of using the trailing comment `#<<` to highlight lines:


.pull-left[
### Code

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +   #<<
  geom_smooth()    #<<
```
````
]

.pull-right[
### Output

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +   #<<
  geom_smooth()    #<<
```
]

???

+  These symbols allow you to easily use Xaringan's highlighting function. If you want to explain code line by line then this might be helpful because students can clearly know what part of the code you are talking about.

## Figure: Create maps with `leaflet`

```{r, fig.dim = c(4, 7)}
map_hpa_bd
```
???
+ You can also insert interactive leaflet maps. By the way, do you know what this is a map of?
---
class: middle

## Tables
For example, regression results can be shown like this. 
.panelset[ 
<!-- Panel 1 -->
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
.medium-code[
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(modelsummary)
library(gt)

# === Load Data === #
url <- 'https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/HistData/Guerry.csv'
dat <- read.csv(url)

# === Run regressions === #
models <- list(
  "OLS 1" = lm(Donations ~ Literacy + Clergy, data = dat),
  "OLS 2" = lm(Crime_pers ~ Literacy + Clergy, data = dat),
  "OLS 3" = lm(Crime_prop ~ Literacy + Clergy, data = dat)
  )
```
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# === Report results with modelsummary === #
modelsummary(
  models, 
  fmt = "%.2f",
  gof_map = c("nobs", "r.squared"),
  stars = TRUE,
  notes = list("You can leave a note here"),
  output = "gt"
  ) %>%
  tab_options(table.font.names = "Times New Roman")
```
  ]
  ]
<!-- Panel 2 -->
.panel[.panel-name[Regression result]
.medium-code[
```{r}
modelsummary(
  models, 
  fmt = "%.2f",
  gof_map = c("nobs", "r.squared"),
  stars = TRUE,
  notes = list("You can leave a note here"),
  output = "gt"
  ) %>%
  tab_options(table.font.names = "Times New Roman")
```
  ]
  ]
]
???
+ This is how regression result tables can be shown. Here I am using model summary and GT packages. They work well with xaringan and HTML.

class: middle

## Animation with `gganimate`

.content-box-yellow[Example 1: PDF and CDF]

```{r, dpi=36, cache=FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
cdf_pdf_gif <- image_read("images/cdf_pdf.gif")
cdf_pdf_gif
```

.medium[
\begin{align*}
\color{blue}{CDF}:& \, F(x) = Pr(X \leq x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(t) dt \\
\color{blue}{PDF}:& \, f(x) = \frac{d}{dx}F(x) \quad \text{by definition of PDF}
\end{align*}
]

???
+ One of the strengths of using HTML based presentations is that we can embed animations into the slides. This animation is showing the relationship between PDF and CDF, normally we learn PDF and CDF with equations but if we show these relationships using animation I think students can more clearly understand the concept.

---

class: middle

## Animation with `gganimate`

.content-box-yellow[Example 2: Measurement error bias in linear regression]

```{r, cache=FALSE, fig.dim = c(8, 5)}
animate(plot_me, fps = 20, duration=10, stard_pause = 10)
```
???
+ This is another example of animation that shows why measurement error causes attenuation bias in linear regression.
---
class: middle

## Citations and references

You can cite any source from your .bib file via [RefManageR](https://docs.ropensci.org/RefManageR/reference/Cite.html) package. You need to setup the `BibOptions` at the beginning of your slides like [this](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki/Bibliography-and-citations).

--

<br>

Then, use `Citet` or `Citep` to cite a source.

.content-box-green[Example: `Citet`]

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# For inline text citation
`r Citet(bib, "xie2022")` created xaringan. 
```
`r Citet(bib, "xie2022")` created xaringan. 


.content-box-green[Example: `Citep`]

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# For inline parenthetical citation
The xaringan package `r Citep(bib, "xie2022")` is an R Markdown extension.
```
The xaringan package `r Citep(bib, "xie2022")` is an R Markdown extension.
???
+ You can use bib file to create citations

---
class: middle

Then, put the following code in a r chunk in the final slides to show all the sources you cited. 

<br>

````markdown
`r ''````{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
PrintBibliography(bib)
```
````

`r fa('exclamation',height='20px',fill='steelblue')` Don't forget to put `results='asis', echo=FALSE` options in a chunk. 
---
class: middle

## Useful Shortcut Keys for presentation

Hit `h` key on the slide. A list of shortcut keys will be popped up. 

To go back to the slides, hit `h` key again. 

```{r, fig.dim = c(4, 7), out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/short-cut.png")
```

## HTML to PDF slides

`to_pdf` funtion of [renderthis](https://github.com/jhelvy/renderthis) package let you render xaringan HTML slides (or .Rmd) to pdf slides.

For more detail, see [this](https://jhelvy.github.io/renderthis/articles/renderthis.html).

`r fa('check',height='20px',fill='lightgreen')`  This function also works with .qmd of Quarto revealjs slides.

<br>

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# === Install package === #
remotes::install_github("jhelvy/renderthis", dependencies = TRUE)

# === Get PDF slides from HTML slides === #
renderthis::to_pdf(
  from = Path/to/an/.Rmd file, # .qmd, .html file, or a UR
  complex_slides = TRUE, 
  partial_slides = TRUE
  )
```
???
+ Finally, you can easily convert your HTML slides to a PDF using a renderthis package.
